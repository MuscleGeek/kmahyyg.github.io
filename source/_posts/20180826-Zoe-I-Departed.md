# 断开连接日

今天尝试了一次完全断开与世界的连接，由于昨天知道有两个快递要到，还是没有关手机。不过真的是停用了所有社交应用，今天专注于 Code 和 写作，只留下电子邮件的感觉非常好。

我觉得我们已经过度信息化，信息超载早已成为定局，我们能做的就是尽量适应。同时尽可能地减少注意力的流失。这一点来说 Google 走在了几大厂商的前面，发布了 Digital Wellbeing，虽然目前只能 Pixel 设备使用，但仍然很有帮助，帮助我减少了很多不必要的查看手机的时间。

完全使用现金支付，在节假日尽可能停用手机是完全可以做到，内心自然也会平静的。这样的确让人感觉非常专注，非常惬意。在魁阁的露台上，品茶、享受着和风，专心地做着自己喜欢的事情，有什么不好的呢？

所以，我宣布：接下来的这个学期，每周六下课之后就进入 24 h 的断开连接状态！有急事需要找我的朋友，请联系我的私人号码或者发邮件给我，公用号码一样开机，只是会被直接 Ignore 罢了。

# 身体

发现自己还是总算可以算得上能吃辣的了，略开心，不过嘛......吃太多对身体不好，熬夜也一样 XD

晚上千万不能喝一整瓶的王老吉或者可乐，半夜三更拉肚子，睡不着觉，难受......

忽然发现，喵喵真的好棒，好想马上就养一只猫，画个大大大的爱心～

# 那些看起来美好的事物

本来懒得措辞了，希望就简短的回复一下，不过估计直接用中文回复的话，会简单地过分，甚至会有 offensive 的味道，想了想，还是用英文吧。

Dear ZoeCat,

Hope this letter finds you well. Thanks for your honesty. I'm in such a happy status that you've already learnt to be determined. First of all, Although things went as this, I still need the seat at the very first row in each class, hope you will not steal it from me.

In the rest of the letter, it will be divided into three parts.

Part one: Q&A time

1. Feel unhappy today?

> Of course not, I just don't want anybody to interupt my disconnected day.

2. What have you done to make me bored?

> Nothing.

3. Treat your cold and guessing......?

> That's the most common way I treat each one in "unrelated people" list.

4. What's the best relationship between to similar ones?

> Follow your hearts, Try your best and then listen to the fate.

Part two: Thoughts

I've already predicted this result at the very beginning of this summer holiday. But I still want to try to do some emergency saving for this relationship,
hope it lasts much longer or keep forever. Remember, I've told you some day that I have some hypothesis to prove. That's it. Some friends have tried to persuade me not to pick you up at the airport. Finally, I still decided to go for it, to do a final confirmation. Saddest, I proved this hypothesis is definitely true. You already answered me several times on your face, so yesterday I told you, "The summer holiday ended, (maybe) see you next semester." Until today, at the time I heard from you, I released, and knew my future plans still need a cleanup as predicted.

Part three: My begging

First of all, I have to inform you that you've already been tagged "blacklist" in my soul mate list after I picked you. You are a good friend, but not a good soul mate. I confirmed you are still a good friend. I'm really sad, but life still goes on. So I'm still happy, Cuz unhappy will only cost me all things without any return. Secondly, I hope there will be no more other reply. Thanks for your understanding.

Hope you have a better day.

Cordially,
Patrick Cat

## The reason I deleted her

I didn't want to do that at the very first time. I could understand that you're protecting yourself. But you know that I won't do any harm to you. You still chose to cheat me. I chose to exchange with my true heart, but you don't even understand it a bit. That's what I can't stand. SEE YOU NEVER!
